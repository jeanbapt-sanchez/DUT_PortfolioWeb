			<h1>My Works</h1>
				<br>
				<br>
			<h3>During my studies I had the opportunity to work on various projects:</h3>
				<br>
			<h3>The Drone Crazyflie - Project for BAC (equivalent British A-Level and High School Diploma) Scientific Sp√©ciality Science of Engineering - 2017-2018</h3>
				<br>
			<p>In high school in 2018 I realized a website that had the concept of making an online game escape game. This game was to be done as part of the ISN project of my specialty for the BAC.</p>
			<p>It's also my first web project where I could learn to use HTML, CSS, PHP and MySQL in concrete terms.</p>
			<p>On this site it was possible to create a user account, to connect with and so to play the game and to try to solve puzzles dotted throughout the site.</p>
				<br>
			<h3>The website "Escape" - Project BAC (equivalent British A-Level and High School Diploma) Scientific Options ISN (equvalent IT) - 2017-2018</h3>
				<br>
			<p>In the same year I realized a project for my Science of Engineering test at BAC. It consisted of studying a drone and its battery in order to be able to program a led display which would give us the autonomy of the drone.</p>
			<p>It allowed me to apply my knowledge in engineering sciences and to use in a realization tools such as the software SolidWorks to design parts to print in 3D or to program with a Arduino.</p>
			<p>I could also use modeling software such as MatLab or ISISS</p>
				<br>
				<br>
			<h3>The Game of Memory - Projet DUT (equivalent to BTECH) Computer Science - December 2018</h3>
				<br>
			<p>Arrived in computer science, I learned a lot in the field of programming. At the end of the first semester, in December 2018 I had to do a new project in binomial.</p>
			<p>This project is to reproduce the game of Memory in C.</p>
			<p>This was my first project that made me use the C language and graphic library of the IUT. It was very important and informative. Below you will see some screenshots of my project</p>

			<h3>The personal website for professional purposes - Project DUT (equivalent to BTECH) Computer Science  - January 2019</h3>
				<br>
			<p>For the end of my first semester of my first year of DUT Informatique (2018 - 2019) I had to make a personal website for professional purposes only as a WEB project. This project corresponds to the site you are on and allowed me to deepen my knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was mandatory to use a minimum of HTML and CSS to create the site.</p>
